# Medium-HANK
This file codes up the medium scale New Keynesian model I used in "A Systematic Analysis of NGDP Targeting" as a heterogeneous agents model. I pull the household block from the sequence-space Jacobian toolbox of Auclert et al. (2021).

My goal by providing this code is to help new users learn how to code DSGE models in Python, particularly by using the SSJ toolbox of Auclert et al. (2021). This code is not guaranteed to be error-free, and there are almost certainly cleaner ways to code up the models - I am still learning too!
